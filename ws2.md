Yes, itâ€™s possible to work with `SplitSink` and `SplitStream` without using a `Mutex`, but this generally involves designing your program to avoid shared mutable state altogether. The key is to structure your code such that each component (sink or stream) is owned by a single task, and communication is performed using channels or other asynchronous primitives. Here's how:

---

### Approach: Use Channels for Communication

You can use `tokio::sync::mpsc` to send messages to a task that owns the `SplitSink`. This allows multiple producers to send messages while only one task manages the actual `SplitSink`. Similarly, you can process incoming messages directly in a task that owns the `SplitStream`.

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use tokio_tungstenite::{connect_async, tungstenite::Message};
use futures_util::stream::{SplitSink, SplitStream};
use futures_util::{SinkExt, StreamExt};
use tokio::net::TcpStream;
use tokio_tungstenite::WebSocketStream;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let url = "wss://example.com/socket";
    let (ws_stream, _) = connect_async(url).await.expect("Failed to connect");

    // Split the WebSocket stream into sink and stream
    let (mut sink, mut stream) = ws_stream.split();

    // Create an mpsc channel for sending messages to the sink
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(32);

    // Task to handle outgoing messages
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(msg) = rx.recv().await {
            if let Err(e) = sink.send(msg).await {
                eprintln!("Failed to send message: {}", e);
                break;
            }
        }
    });

    // Task to handle incoming messages
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(Ok(msg)) = stream.next().await {
            println!("Received: {:?}", msg);
        }
    });

    // Example: Sending messages through the channel
    let _ = tx.send(Message::Text("Hello, WebSocket!".into())).await;
    let _ = tx.send(Message::Text("Another message!".into())).await;

    // Wait for some time before exiting
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Ownership of `SplitSink` and `SplitStream`**:
   - The `SplitSink` and `SplitStream` are owned by their respective tasks (`sink` handler and `stream` handler). This avoids the need for sharing or cloning.

2. **Communication via Channels**:
   - The `mpsc::channel` allows multiple producers to send messages to a single consumer (the task that owns the `SplitSink`).

3. **Concurrent Processing**:
   - The `SplitStream` is processed in a separate task, handling incoming messages without any need for shared state.

### Advantages
- **No Mutex Overhead**: Since the `SplitSink` and `SplitStream` are owned by their tasks, there's no need for locking mechanisms.
- **Concurrency-Friendly**: Using channels ensures clean and safe communication between tasks.

### Trade-offs
- **Channel Overhead**: While channels are efficient, they introduce a small overhead compared to direct usage.
- **More Complex Code**: This approach requires splitting responsibilities across tasks, which might make the code harder to follow.

If you can design your application around this model, you can avoid `Mutex` and still achieve safe, concurrent communication.
