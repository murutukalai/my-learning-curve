To install `gdk 0.3.pc`, which refers to a `.pc` (pkg-config) file for the GDK library version 0.3, you'll need to install the corresponding development package for the GDK library. GDK is part of the GTK (GIMP Toolkit) library, and the `pkg-config` file helps configure build systems to locate and link to the library.

Follow these steps based on your Linux distribution:

### For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
1. **Update your package list**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install the development package for GDK/GTK**:
   ```
   sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
   ```
   This package includes both GTK 3 and GDK, along with their necessary development files, including `.pc` files for `pkg-config`.

3. **Verify the installation**:
   You can verify the `.pc` file exists by checking the directory where `pkg-config` looks for it:
   ```
   pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
   ```
   This will output the directories where `.pc` files are located. You can check if the `gdk-3.0.pc` or related file is present in one of those directories.

### For Fedora/RHEL/CentOS-based systems:
1. **Install the development package for GDK/GTK**:
   ```
   sudo dnf install gtk3-devel
   ```

2. **Verify the installation** as mentioned above.

### For Arch-based systems:
1. **Install the GTK development package**:
   ```
   sudo pacman -S gtk3
   ```

After installing the necessary development package, you should have access to the `.pc` files, including `gdk-3.0.pc`.
